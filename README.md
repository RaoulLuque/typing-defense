# Typing-Defense

Is a tower defense game in which one has to type in order to defeat monsters that try to breach the castle. The game is written using the [bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/) in the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It is more of a fun project in order to get an insight into game development, the bevy game engine and further understanding Rust.

To start the game check the bevy setup [page](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup/) for dependencies needed for compiling bevy projects locally. Then it's just running
